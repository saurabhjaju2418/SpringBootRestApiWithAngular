# Basic CRUD App with Angular 5.0 and Spring Boot 2.0

This example app shows how to build a basic CRUD app with Spring Boot 2.0, Spring Data, and Angular 5.0.

 <b>Prerequisites</b>: [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Getting Started
To install this example application, run the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/saurabhjaju2418/SpringBootRestApiWithAngular.git`
`cd SpringBootRestApiWithAngular`

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. To install all of its dependencies and start each app, follow the instructions<br/> below.
To run the server, cd into the `server` folder and run:

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

To run the client, cd into the `client` folder and run:

`npm install && npm start`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
